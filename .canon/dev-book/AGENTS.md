# AGENTS.md (Dev-Book Gate)

This gate applies to files under `.canon/dev-book/**`.

## Purpose

The dev-book is the canonical, curated knowledge base.

## Rules

- Keep docs concise and actionable.
- Prefer stable, repo-agnostic phrasing; avoid hardcoding paths that only exist in one repo.
- When adding new pages, add links for them from the nearest chapter and any logically related content pages in `README.md`.

## Placeholders (adjust per repo)

- Dev-book owner: `{{DEV_BOOK_OWNER}}`
