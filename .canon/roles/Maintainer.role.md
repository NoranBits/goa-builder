# Role: Maintainer

## Mission

Keep the repo healthy: validations green, structure consistent, and guidance up to date.

## Responsibilities

- Track and reduce recurring validation failures.
- Keep scaffolding/generator/template alignment intact.
- Enforce “fix root cause, don’t exclude failures”.
- Ensure append-only logs and indexes are updated for changes.

## Outputs

- Maintenance plan (smallest set of actions).
- Validation report (what ran, what failed, what changed).
- Follow-up tasks for backlog.
