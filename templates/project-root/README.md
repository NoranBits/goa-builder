# Project-Root Templates

## Purpose

Files under `templates/project-root/**` are installed into the target repo root.

## Notes

- Some files are high-impact governance or guidance files and are created only if missing.
- Generated `.canon/**` and `.toolkit/**` main structure should remain repo-agnostic but may include repo-specific extensions as we learn more about the repository.

## Placeholders (adjust per repo)

- Repo name: `{{REPO_NAME}}`
- Primary language/runtime: `{{PRIMARY_RUNTIME}}`
