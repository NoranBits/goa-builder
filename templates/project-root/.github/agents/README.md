# .github/agents

## Purpose

Agent profiles define specialized behavior for codebase roles.

## Rules

- Keep profiles short, explicit, and scoped.
- Avoid overlapping responsibilities.
- Do not exceed repo-enforced profile counts.

## Placeholders (adjust per repo)

- Required agents: `{{REQUIRED_AGENTS}}`
- Agent count limit: `{{AGENT_PROFILE_LIMIT}}`
