# .toolkit

> **Context**: This directory contains the operational scripts and local automation tools that power the repository's daily maintenance. While `.github` handles CI/CD, `.toolkit` handles local developer tasks and "glue" code.

## Purpose

`.toolkit/**` is the repo-agnostic tool surface generated by `.builder`.

It is designed for:

- **Fast repo understanding** (scan/search).
- **Repeatable validation** (lint/typecheck/format/markdown).
- **Safe build/test automation**.
- **Structured logs** for debugging and audit.

It is designed to be safe-by-default and easy for agents (and humans) to extend.

## Layout

- **`scan/`**: Discover what this repo is and where key entry points live.
- **`search/`**: Fast code search helpers (grep/rg wrappers, symbol maps, etc.).
- **`validate/`**: Lint/typecheck/markdown gates and policy checks.
- **`test/`**: Smallest-relevant test runners and focused repro tools.
- **`log/`**: Log collection, normalization, and analysis helpers.
- **`build/`**: Build pipelines and packaging prerequisites.
- **`install/`**: Bootstrap scripts for dependencies and dev env.
- **`package/`**: Bundle artifacts for release or deployment.
- **`update/`**: Maintenance tasks (deps, lockfiles, snapshots).

Each category has a `README.md` defining its contract.

## Layering Model

Treat `.toolkit/**` as three layers:

1. **Contracts**: `README.md` in each category defines what “good” looks like.
2. **Stable tools**: Promoted scripts that are safe, documented, and used often.
3. **Experimental tools**: `custom-tools/` prototypes and one-offs.

## Composition (Prefer Fewer, Stronger Tools)

Agents should not need to run 6 commands in a row to get a reliable outcome. Design tools to be composable, then create a small set of “composite tools” that bundle the common sequences.

Good composites:

- **`quality_gate`**: `validate` + fast `test` + markdown policy.
- **`triage_bug`**: `scan` + `search` + `log` bundle + minimal repro.
- **`prepare_release`**: `build` + `package` + integrity checks.
