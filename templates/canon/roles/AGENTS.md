# AGENTS.md (Roles Gate)

This gate applies to files under `.canon/roles/**`.

## Rules

- Roles are contracts: keep them stable and explicit.
- Prefer checklists and expected outputs over prose.
- If you add a role, update `.canon/roles/README.md`.

## Placeholders (adjust per repo)

- Role review owner: `{{ROLES_OWNER}}`
