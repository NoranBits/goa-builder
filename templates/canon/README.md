# .canon (Canonical Knowledge Base)

This folder is the canonical knowledge base generated/maintained by the GOA Builder (Game Operational Agents Builder).

## What belongs here

- Policies, constraints, and operating procedures.
- The dev-book (structure-first, minimal content initially).
- Role playbooks under `roles/`.
- The audit spine under `logs/`.
- The repo map under `navigator/`.
- External project digests under `external/`.

## What does not belong here

- Runtime output logs (use `.logs/` and gitignore it).
- Vendored upstream code (if any, it must be stored under a dedicated upstream area and gitignored).
