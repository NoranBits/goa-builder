# Dev Book

> **Context**: The `dev-book` is the primary human-readable documentation structure for the project. It follows a "Structure-First" philosophy, ensuring a place for everything before content is written.

## Purpose

This dev-book is intentionally minimal at bootstrap time. It provides the **slots** where knowledge should go, preventing the "dump everything in README" anti-pattern.

## Chapters

1. **`01-overview`**: High-level mental model, architecture, and features.
2. **`02-getting-started`**: Onboarding, installation, and first steps.
3. **`03-user-guides`**: Tutorials and manuals for end-users.
4. **`04-architecture`**: Deep dives into system design and decision records.
5. **`05-world-and-simulation`**: Game state, physics, and rules.
6. **`06-networking-and-multiplayer`**: Replication, state sync, and protocols.
7. **`07-ai-and-npcs`**: Behavior trees, pathfinding, and agent logic.
8. **`08-tools-and-pipelines`**: Editors, asset processors, and build systems.
9. **`09-content-authoring`**: Art, sound, and level design workflows.
10. **`10-data-and-storage`**: Databases, save files, and serialization.
11. **`11-testing-and-qa`**: Test strategies, automation, and coverage.
12. **`12-observability-and-logs`**: Metrics, tracing, and debugging.
13. **`13-security-and-safety`**: Auth, cheat prevention, and data privacy.
14. **`14-deployment`**: CI/CD, cloud infra, and release process.
15. **`15-appendix`**: Glossaries, legacy notes, and miscellany.
