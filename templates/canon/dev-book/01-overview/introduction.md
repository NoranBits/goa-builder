# Introduction

## What this dev-book is

This `.canon/dev-book/` is the project’s **digested, navigable knowledge base**.

It is intentionally written to support:

- Fast onboarding for humans and agents
- Stable entry points that link deeper into the codebase
- Incremental updates as the project evolves

## How to use it

- Start here, then follow links into chapter pages.
- Prefer short pages that link to concrete sources (code paths, READMEs, configs).
- When you learn something new, update the most relevant page and add cross-links.

## Key outputs

- Architecture overview and diagrams
- Feature map with ownership and entry points
- Tech stack summary with constraints and build/test commands

## Next links

- `tech-stack.md`
- `architecture.md`
- `features.md`
