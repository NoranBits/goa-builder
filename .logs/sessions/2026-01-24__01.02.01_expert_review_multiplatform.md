Session: 01.02.01 — Expert review: Multiplatform scan availability
Date: 2026-01-24T00:00:00Z

Overview:
- Implemented cross-platform launcher ` .toolkit/scan/run_refresh_navigator.py` to run navigator scripts on Windows, Linux/macOS, and Android/Termux.
- Added usage documentation `.toolkit/scan/USAGE.md` describing platform commands and `--step-id` guidance.

Rationale:
- Many developer environments include Windows or mobile (Termux) where native shell scripts differ; a small Python wrapper ensures consistent behavior across platforms and reduces onboarding friction.

Security & Activation:
- Tools that write repo state are gated by `tools/require_activation.py`; CI/maintainers should ensure activation before running write-capable generator scripts.

Next steps:
- Update other write-capable tools (markdownlint runner, consolidate_memory, generator) to accept `--step-id` and write JSON metadata into `.logs/validation/`.
- Add CI job to optionally upload large SARIF artifacts to external archival and populate `.builder/package/archives/validation_archive_metadata.json` with pointers.

Reviewer: Context Architect (expert review) — changes approved for inclusion in `v3.5`.
